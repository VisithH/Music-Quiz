I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head
Been gone and facin' horrors that should never be said
The wrath and the grit from the pit of despair
Been takin' every whip and word, I've never been spared
They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
They say that angels are among us
Lock me up in a maze (oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (oh)
I was born, I was raised for this (oh)
Turn out, turn out the lights (oh, turn out the lights)
Lock me up inside a cage
Just throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me
I was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast
I could do this with my eyes closed
(Turn out, turn out the lights)
I could do this with my eyes closed
(Turn out, turn out the lights)
I could do this with my eyes closed
Less medications, less manifestations
Mantras, meditation, throw it all away
All the places I've been, all the blood that I've bled
I've been broken down and beat up, but I still get ahead
All the faceless embraces and the tasteless two-faces
Killed and resurrected 'cause I'll never be dead
They say tomorrow's never promised, honest
Yeah, they say piranhas are among us

I could, I could do this with my eyes-
And when the day broke, buried in violence
Somethin' made my mind up
I will spend these days as an island
Alone and far away

Got a million people saying how to plan it
I can no longer stand it

I owe
Nothing, not a penny, never wanna hear you preach

You could have the mountains, ah
You take the snow, ah
It's way too cold
My heart is cold enough, ah

If you want it, come and get it
Got a million people telling me they're with it
And they got me at my limit
And I'm telling you, I never spare a minute
If you wanna keep on living
For the sucker that is telling you your limit
Gotta find out it's a gimmick
Can't nobody tell you how to live it

Nothing, not a penny, never walking on a leash

I'm better off alone
Like a rolling stone
Turning off my phone
No one bringing me down, down, down, down
Just give me some space
That sun in my face
